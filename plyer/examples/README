Each facade has its own set of examples here. For each facade, there is a 
simple example which shows basic usage of the facade and its options. This 
simple example typically requires Kivy to run and buildozer to compile for 
Android. There may also be more advanced examples for a facade. Requirements 
for the advanced examples may require a different framework (QT, Tkinter, etc) 
or additional Python modules.
